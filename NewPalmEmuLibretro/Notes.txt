WinOverlay mode -vvv-
Write color-matched source pixel to the destination if the source pixel is not transparent.
Transparent pixels are skipped. For a 1-bit display, the “off” bits are considered to be the transparent color.
Note that this definition of winOverlay is new for Palm OS 5: in Palm OS 4.x, the destination is set (only) where
the source pixels are “on.”
-^^^-

When the hasTransparency flag is set and the transfer mode is winPaint, only the non-transparent pixels
are copied to the destination. With text and patterns, the Palm OS assumes that the “off” bits are the ones
designated as transparent and acts as if the hasTransparency flag is always false. This assumption retains backwards
compatibility and unifies the use of transparency across all source data.
