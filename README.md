# PersianTree
A new palm os emulator with the end goal of emulating palm os 5.x and the tapwave custom api.

This is not for end users, the app paths are hardcoded right now and the only game working is zap2016 and its speed is off.

Nothing is perfect.

WORKING:
Framebuffer output
Palm device buttons
PRC and PDB file loading

BROKEN:
Sound
Keyboard input
Arm Emulation
Everything else

This project has resumed!



# Here are the rules for making requests:

The goal of this project is to emulate all palm os apps not hackmaster hacks, theme tools, palm linux, emulators running under palm os or games that are already ported to all platforms, I will provide no support for these, if they work great, if they dont they probably never will.

You may request support for an app.

Multiple requests at once are allowed as long as they are reasonable.(Not "all fps games")

Requests are fifo, when the programs I care about run whoever requested first will be the one fixed first.

Any request for external hardware will be done last.(Modem, ir, external card reader, clie joypad)

Games and tools will receive equal priority.

Repeating the same request multipule times after being denied will result in you being banned from the project.

This is Palm OS emulator, it does not emulate Windows Mobile, Windows Phone, WebOS, Blackberry, j2me, IOS, Android or any other handheld operating system.
