A new palm os emulator with the end goal of emulating palm os 5.x and the tapwave custom api.

This is not for end users,the app paths are hardcoded right now and the only game working is zap2016 and its speed is off.

Nothing is perfect.

WORKING:
Framebuffer output,
Palm device buttons,
PRC and PDB file loading

BROKEN:
Sound,
Keyboard input,
Arm Emulation,
Everything else

This project has resumed!
