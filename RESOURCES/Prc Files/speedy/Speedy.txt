Overview
--------

Speedy is a benchmark utility for PalmOS based devices.
Speedy performs three resource taking routines (calculation, 
memory access and graphical display) to measure the real 
performance of your device.
Speedy is especially useful in different cases :
- to check that your PalmOS based device behaves and 
  performs like it should;
- to see the impact of CPU down/over-clocking upon your 
  device's performance;
- to see how a specific software or hardware modifies your
  device's performance;
- to really compare different devices and benchmark them.
Your device's performance is ranked on several charts against
baseline measurements of other common PalmOS compatible devices. 
Speedy reports both a CPU frequency and a relative 
index (100% is for the Palm Vx at 20 MHz).



Notice for Speedy results with ARM devices
------------------------------------------

Speedy was initially designed to work with the former generation 
of Palm OS based devices running a DragonBall processor.

In its current version, Speedy has been upgraded to take into 
account the specificities of the new ARM based devices and to 
re-evaluate the accuracy of the results returned.

But, when the benchmark would run during 15 seconds for a 20 MHz 
DragonBall device, it runs in less than one second for the new 
high speed ARM devices. As a consequence, precision is a little
bit depreciated with the new devices.

--------------

If you need a processor overclocking (and downclocking) utility, 
you might want to consider my SYSINFO shareware program which 
includes this functionality for Motorola DragonBalls processors.

SysInfo is to be found on my web site: http://www.aldweb.com
You will also find other great Palm applications on my website :-)

I also decided to add a not too boring advertisement screen to 
Speedy (it can even be unactivated in the options if you’d rather 
have the standard "Please wait…" message), while waiting for the 
Speedy’s initial processes to be operated. This is a way for me 
to promote my other applications.

I am open to discuss for eventual partnerships & sponsoring to 
provide advertising for other companies.



Donate...
---------

Speedy is free to use. However, if you like it, please consider
making a donation to show your support. Any amount will be 
highly appreciated. To proceed, just connect to: 
  http://give.aldweb.com/ (secured PayPal transaction)
For your information, the usual donation amount is of US$ 10 = EUR 10

Please let me express here a personal thought: very few people 
donated for Speedy so far. I think that this is a pity given 
the number of downloads and of people using it on a regular 
basis: http://trackerdog.a0soft.com/ reports Speedy as one of 
the TOP 30 popular Palm software!
I hope that you can understand the feeling of a developer who 
spent so many hours, as a hobby, to provide you this software 
for free and who feels to receive very little consideration 
in return...

Therefore, I thank from the bottom of my heart all people who 
donated, as well as all of those who sent me an e-mail to say 
thank you or to participate by providing their device's 
benchmark values (see paragraph Speedy's database relies on 
you! here under).



How to install Speedy?
----------------------

Minimum Palm OS requirement is version 2.0

Speedy is Palm OS version 5 compliant.

Speedy is a PRC file that is installed like any other 
Palm OS file using HotSync. So, extract Speedy.PRC from the
ZIP archive file. Double-click on it and the Palm install tool
will popup. Speedy.PRC will be transferred to your Palm
device next time you synchronize your device with your PC with
HotSync.

Black & white, gray scaled and color versions of Speedy are
available. Whether your device is color enabled or not, 
Speedy will automatically detect it and adapt to display
all items in black & white, in gray scale or in color.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
  Uninstall any version earlier than 5.2 of Speedy before
  installing this one on your device. This version of 
  Speedy may be installed on top of version 5.2 and all later
  versions.



Credits
-------

I would like to address here a very special THANK YOU to 
THE one person who keeps helping me improving and updating 
Speedy: Jérôme Fresnay.
Thank you Jérôme, your help is really appreciated.

Thank you Schtunks for designing the new Speedy icons, they are 
really beautiful!

Let's also thank all people who helped me at the early stages 
of the Speedy project: @tomic, Daniel Brettnacher, Yves Duveau,
Claude Fauvel, all folks from the PalmSpirit and the PeekPocket 
forums.



Speedy's database relies on you!
--------------------------------

Thanks also to all people who e-mailed me their device's results. 

There is still quite a substantial list of devices for which full 
benchmark information (Calc, Mem, Graph Tests and Total results) 
is currently missing in Speedy's database. 

As expected, the information is given for the most widely spread 
devices. But it would be great to also have the benchmark value 
for the rare devices.

So, please, keep sending me results for your devices! 

New as of version 7.0: Speedy works like a charm in the StyleTap
Platform (www.styletap.com). StyleTap is a Palm OS emulator for 
Windows Mobile devices. So, you also may want to send me the 
results of the Speedy benchmark for these devices.



Updates Description
-------------------

  7.1 (05/31/08)
    - added benchmark values for the Palm Centro device
    - added partial benchmark result for the GSL Xplore M28 
      and M70
    - added the best ever obtained benchmark on a device after
      overclocking, this was on my own Palm Tungsten C using
      Lightspeed. Would you succeed to get a better one 
      on another device, please let me know :-)
    - added explanations in the Devices screen (i) about what 
      the used abbreviations ([-], [*], [P], [L], [f+], [WM], 
      [66%] and [100%]) mean

  7.0 (03/24/08)
    - added detection of Speedy running in the StyleTap Palm OS 
      emulator for Windows mobile devices (www.styletap.com)
    - added benchmark values for the HTC S710 device (Windows
      Mobile 6.0 for Smartphone), running Speedy inside the 
      StyleTap platform  
    - added benchmark values for the Palm Treo 755p device
    - updated the benchmark value for the Palm Treo 680 (the 
      previous reference record for the Graph Test was 0.1 sec 
      too pessimistic on the average) 
    - refined the number of devices' counter, it was previously
      counting twice the same device when this device could have
      benchmark results in portrait or landscape modes (for 
      example, the Palm TX was in this case)
    - added a bunch of exotic devices in the database, even if
      no benchmark results were ever provided for them, so as 
      to have an exhaustive database of Palm OS based devices 
      in Speedy's knowledge base

  6.4 (09/05/07)
    - added full details of benchmark value for the Handpsring
      Visor Neo
    - added one-handed navigation feature
    - fixed default button in the Detail Device and the
      Advertisement screens
    - added a new paragraph in the user manual, about how 
      listening to music running in the background affects the
      device's performance and how Speedy helps evaluating it

  6.3 (12/02/06)
    - added benchmark values for the Palm Treo 680 device

  6.2 (09/18/06)
    - added benchmark values for the Palm Treo 700p and Aceeca 
      Meazura devices

  6.1 (11/14/05)
    - fixed a bug from version 6.0 that would cause a very bad 
      crash in some rare cases
      upgrading from version 6.0 is highly recommended
    - added high resolution icons in the Detail Device screen
    - a few other minor cosmetic changes in the About Box

  6.0 (10/26/05)
    - added benchmark values for Palm IIIe, Palm VIIx, Palm TX,
      Palm Z22 and GSL Xplore M68
    - upgraded processor information for GSL Xplore M28 and
      Hunetec H500, although results for these devices are 
      still badly missing in Speedy's database...
    - massive review of the source code, which was quite required 
      after more than 4 years of patching Speedy upon each new
      version
    - the application's Saved Preferences were also "revamped",
      Speedy will from now on remember your selection of devices 
      and your [last] and [saved] results when upgrading
    - when the benchmark would run during 15 seconds for a 
      20 MHz DragonBall device, it runs in less than one second 
      for the new high speed ARM devices. As a consequence, 
      accuracy was a little bit depreciated with the new devices
      => now the Speedy benchmark is run 5 times for ARM devices,
      and the average benchmark value is calculated in order to 
      increase results accuracy (of about 0.01 sec) 
    - moved the "Save [last]" and "Save [now]" menu items from
      the Options menu to the Application menu
    - the "Save [last]" and "Save [now]" menu items now 
      correctly update the benchmark graph screen with the
      newly [saved] values
    - a few minor cosmetic changes (a space character was 
      inserted between "Speedy" and the version number in the 
      title when saving results to memo, the "Please wait..." 
      initial message was centered vertically)
    - the "Please wait..." initial message is now provided with
      a progress bar
    - added an advertisement screen for my other applications,
      to replace the standard "Plase wait..." initial message ;-)
      But, if you find it "boring", there is a user friendly 
      option to remove it... :-)
    - finally took the time to integrate the nice high 
      resolution icon that Schtunks had designed especially for
      Speedy, well just 2 years ago!
    - registered the CreatorIDs for the SCells, SMatches and 
      SNumerus sample timing applications; I had to change SCells'
      CreatorID to LDsC because the older one used was already
      reserved by another application 
    - last but not least, upgraded the documentation (Speedy.PDF 
      file) which had not evolved in the last 2 years

  5.2 (06/06/05)
    - added benchmark values for Palm LifeDrive and Garmin 
      iQue 3200
    - source code optimization (~2% decrease of the program 
      size) and slightly faster initial program loading

  5.1 (05/11/05)
    - added benchmark values for Palm Tungsten E2 and Tapwave 
      Zodiac 2
    - changed benchmark values for Palm Tungsten E because they
      were not correct (overestimated)
    - added bookmarks in the user manual (PDF file) for easier
      browsing through the documentation

  5.0 (03/14/05)
    - added a new {No device} selection to allow choosing less 
      than 5 reference devices to display and compare your 
      device with
    - Speedy now unactivates pen interactions when running the 
      benchmark routines so as not to distort benchmark results
      (available for devices with Palm OS < 5 only, as PACE for
      Palm OS 5 considers the "system use only" related API 
      calls as NOPS, i.e. No OPerationS) 
    - added benchmark values for Fossil Wrist PDA, Sony Clié 
      N760C, Palm VII (1st generation, simple DragonBall 
      processor) and AlphaSmart Dana Wireless, and partial 
      benchmark information for IBM Workpad (10u), IBM Workpad 
      (20X), IBM Workpad (40U), IBM Workpad 2 (22X), IBM 
      Workpad 2 (30X), IBM Workpad c3, IBM Workpad c500 and IBM 
      Workpad c505
    - in a search to be exhaustive, I added some 50 devices to 
      Speedy's database, even if most of the new devices come
      with no benchmark data so far
    - given that there are now some 126 devices in Speedy's
      database, I upgraded the source code to sort and list all 
      devices automatically and, therefore, ease my work for 
      future upgrades!
    - Speedy now reports the number of devices with full 
      benchmark data, partial benchmark data or missing 
      benchmark information
    - even though so few people donated for Speedy so far (and
      I think that this is a pity given the number of downloads
      and of people using it... see the Donate paragraph above), 
      I updated the donation URL

  4.1 (12/02/04)
    - added benchmark values for Palm IIIxe, Handspring Treo 
      180, Handspring Visor Platinum, PalmOne Treo 650 and 
      PalmOne Tungsten T5

  4.0 (10/04/04)
    - split all ARM devices by processor model (Texas 
      Instrument OMAP, Intel XScale, Motorala i.MX1/i.MXL and 
      Sony CDX2230GA).
      Upgraded the Devices & Color Picker options accordingly,
      and also added processor type vizualisation in the 
      devices' details window
    - moved the devices database from the internal code to 
      dedicated resources. As a result the program size 
      became 20% smaller for the same number of devices (54 in 
      version 3.5), and program size remained the same (when 
      compared to version 3.5) even with all additional 
      features of this new version 4.0
    - added benchmark values for Sony Clié TJ35 and for 
      Samsung SGH-i530
    - added devices with partial or empty information for the 
      following 16 devices: GSpda Xplore G18, GSpda Xplore 
      G88, HandEra TRGPro, Handspring Treo 180, Handspring 
      Treo 180G, Handspring Visor Neo, Handspring Visor 
      Platinum, Handspring Visor Pro, Palm i705, Palm IIIe, 
      Palm IIIxe, Samsung SGH-i505, Samsung SPH-i500, Sony 
      Clié N760C, Sony Clié NR70 and Sony Clié S360. 
      These devices are marked with a [*] or [-] sign in 
      Speedy's database depending on whether they are with 
      partial or no results.
      The devices' details window was upgraded to reflect 
      this partial knowledge 
    - the devices' details window was fully redesigned to
      look nicer and with additional information (processor)
    - added a button to switch automatically from Speedy to 
      some processors overclocking software (this is very 
      convenient when you want to validate down/over-clocking
      settings). These software are: 
        FastCPU - for DragonBall overclocking
          http://www.megasoft2000.com/
        Lightspeed - for ARM overclocking
          http://www.clievideo.com/
        PXA Clocker - for ARM overclocking
          http://www.hexview.com/pxa/
        SysInfo - for DragonBall overclocking, my own software!
          http://www.aldweb.com/  
    - buttons are now hidden while the benchmark is running,
      so as not to sidestep the issue of the benchmark results 
      if the user presses a button by mistale at that time 
    - Speedy can now work with the new Memos application
      introduced in PalmOS 5.2.8?, PMem/DATA creator/type 
    - removed the Save to Memo option of benchmark results for 
      the now very old Palm OS 2.0 PalmPilot devices because of 
      a memory stack overflow bringing to a soft reset 

  3.5 (06/05/04)
    - added benchmark values for Sony Clié TJ27, Palm Zire 31 
      and Palm Zire 72
    - added a new Color Picker option to allow customizing the
      colors of the bars according to processors types 

  3.4 (04/06/04)
    - added benchmark values for Sony Clié TH55, Sony Clié TJ37 
      and Palm Zire 21

      so I removed the Kyocera 7135 specific version
    - added the number of registered devices in the About box

  3.3 (02/17/04)
    - replaced device short name by device full name in the
      benchmark details window
    - added a new menu option giving the number of devices 
      registered in Speedy's database and inviting you to send 
      me the benchmark results for devices not yet listed 
    - reviewed the benchmark reference value for Palm Tungsten T
      which was wrong (thanks to Mike Shofield for pointing it 
      out)
    - added benchmark values for Garmin iQue 3600 and for 
      Acer s10

  3.2 (01/19/04)
    - added access to the Devices list and selection window 
      from the Detail Device popup window

      and Palm Tungsten W
    - optimized source code

  3.1 (10/22/03)
    - changed values for Palm Zire 71 (was wrong) and for 
      Palm Tungsten T3 too (T3 suffers from slowdown bug 
      in some cases: http://www.clievideo.com/T3Bugfix.zip or
      http://t3optimizer.mobilevoodoo.com/ for explanations)
    - added benchmark values for Tapwave Zodiac, for Sony Clié
      SJ22 and for Kyocera 7135
    - created a Kyocera 7135 version of Speedy (standard one
      does not work with this device)
