The keyboard support in SrcEdit is mostly about cursor key navigation: the ability to use Shift to select, Ctrl to move word by word, Cmd to larger amounts, Del to delete the character to the right, Tab to indent selected lines, Shift-Tab to un-indent selected lines, etc.    
<BR><BR>
    
Each keyboard in the list below is linked to a chart showing what functionality is implemented, what keys combinations you have to press, and what behaviour you should expect from SrcEdit. The goal  has been to mimic (as much as possible) the behaviour of mainstream Windows editors, such as Notepad, TextPad, SourceEdit, etc.   
<BR><BR>
