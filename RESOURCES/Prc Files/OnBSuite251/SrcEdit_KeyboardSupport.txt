SrcEdit and Keyboard Support (External and Internal) 
---------------------------------------------------
version: 0.85

Task: #846728 (S016), by John Wilund 25 April 2004

With the release of version 2.4 SrcEdit, keyboard users can benefit from the
same 'cursor key' functions available in many Windows editors.

Sincere thanks goes to: Dale Hurtt and Fabio Di Giorgio for helping me with
collecting the data, writing this document and checking the SrcEdit functionallity
against it. Thanks guys!

The SrcEdit keyboard support is largely about cursor key navigation.
The ability to use Shift to select, Ctrl to move word by word, Cmd to larger amounts,
Del to delete the character to the right, Tab to indent selected lines, Shift-Tab to
unindent selected lines, etc.

PLEASE OBSERVE! YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE YOUR KEYBOARD (Menu/Options/Keyboard Support)
BEFORE ANY CURSOR KEY NAVIGATION IS SUPPORTED!

Below is a chart of what functionality is implemented, what keys combinations
you have to press, and what behaviour you should expect from SrcEdit. The goal
has been to mimic (as much as possible) the behaviour of mainstream Windows
editors, such as Notepad, TextPad, SourceEdit, etc.

Key(s)        Notes   SrcEdit.prc action
------------------------------------------
[Up]            1     Moves the cursor to the previous line at the same
                      character position in the line (if possible). The view
                      adjusts if the cursor moves off-screen.
[Down]          1     Moves the cursor to the next line at the same character
                      position in the line (if possible). The view adjusts if
                      the cursor moves off-screen.
[Left]          2     Moves the cursor one character to the left. If the cursor
                      is at the beginning of the line, the cursor moves to the
                      end of the previous line. The view adjusts if the cursor
                      moves off-screen.
[Right]         2     Moves the cursor one character to the right. If the cursor
                      is at the end of the line, the cursor moves to the
                      beginning of the next line. The view adjusts if the cursor
                      moves off-screen.

[Shift][Up]     3     Adds the preceding line to the selection if moving away
                      from the cursor or removes the bottom line of the
                      selection if moving towards the cursor.
[Shift][Down]   3     Adds the suceeding line to the selection if moving away
                      from the cursor or removes the top line of the
                      selection if moving towards the cursor.
[Shift][Left]   4     Adds the preceding character to the selection if moving
                      away from the cursor or removes the last character of the
                      selection if moving towards the cursor.
[Shift][Right]  4     Adds the suceeding character to the selection if moving
                      away from the cursor or removes the first character of the
                      selection if moving towards the cursor.

[Ctrl][Up]      5     Scrolls the view up one line (unless the top of the
                      document is already visible). The cursor will not move
                      unless it scrolls from view, at which time it will move to
                      the bottommost visible line at the same character position
                      in the line (if possible).
[Ctrl][Down]    5     Scrolls the view up down line (unless the bottom of the
                      document is already visible). The cursor will not move
                      unless it scrolls from view, at which time it will move to
                      the topmost visible line at the same character position
                      in the line (if possible).
[Ctrl][Left]    6     Moves the cursor to the beginning of the previous word. If
                      the cursor is at the first word in the line, the cursor
                      moves to the last word of the previous line. The view
                      adjusts if the cursor moves off-screen.
[Ctrl][Right]   6     Moves the cursor to the beginning of the next word. If the
                      cursor is at the last word in the line, the cursor moves
                      to the first word of the next line. The view adjusts if
                      the cursor moves off-screen.

[Cmd][Up]       7     Moves the cursor to before the first character of the
                      document. The view adjusts if the cursor moves off-screen.
[Cmd][Down]     7     Moves the cursor to after the last character of the
                      document. The view adjusts if the cursor moves off-screen.
[Cmd][Left]     8     Moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line. The
                      view adjusts if the cursor moves off-screen. This is the
                      [Home] key.
[Cmd][Right]    8     Moves the cursor to the end of the current line. The view
                      adjusts if the cursor moves off-screen. This is the [End]
                      key.

[PageUp]        9     Moves the cursor up one Page. The view adjusts so that the
                      topmost visible line moves just off-screen to the bottom
                      (i.e. if line 20 was the topmost visible line, after a
                      [PageUp] line 19 would be the bottommost visible line).
[PageDown]      9     Moves the cursor down one Page. The view adjusts so that
                      the bottommost visible line moves just off-screen to the
                      top (i.e. if line 20 was the bottommost visible line,
                      after a [PageDown] line 21 would be the topmost visible
                      line).

[PageLeft]      10    Scrolls the Screen to the left. Does NOT move the cursor.

[PageRight]     10    Scrolls the Screen to the right. Does NOT move the cursor.

[Del]           11    Deletes the character to the right of the cursor. If the
                      cursor is at the end of a line, this moves the contents of
                      the following line into the current line.

[Tab]           12    If there is a selection then [Tab] indents (add one tab to
                      the beginning of each selected line), otherwise it will just
                      insert a tab in the text.

[Shift][Tab]    13    If there is a selection [Shift][Tab] will removes one tab if
                      it is possible from the beginning of each selected line,
                      otherwise it will move the cursor in a tab sized step towards
                      the beginning of the line.
