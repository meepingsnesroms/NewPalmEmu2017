The StuntPlane application is an example of how to write a simple
game using only the features provided by the X-Forge Core.
For 2D games and very simple 3D games this might actually be easier than
using the full blown X-Forge Game Engine.
</p><p>
The purpose of the game is quite simple. The player is piloting a biplane and 
must fly through hoops of different shapes while collecting as many bonus items 
as possible. The plane can be moved around in the vertical plane and rolled in
45-degree steps along it's direction of movement. The plane is always moving
forward with a constant speed. On each level the player must not crash into
or miss more than 3 hoops, or the game will be over.
</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id434362"></a>Implementation</h2></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id434372"></a>The main application class</h3></div></div><p>
<tt>StuntPlane.cpp</tt> contains the main application
class. The <tt>StuntPlane</tt> class inherits from the
<tt>XFcApp</tt> class and thus has the responsibility to
initialize and shut down the application, as well as controlling the
main application flow and taking care of other external events.
</p><p>
Regardless of which renderer is active, the
<tt>onTick()</tt> method of the class that inherits
from <tt>XFcApp</tt> is called just before rendering starts. 
We can thus use this
function to implement a global state machine. When a state change is needed, for
example when the player has missed four hoops and the game is over,
the <tt>setState()</tt> method in <tt>StuntPlane</tt> is called, in this
particular case with the parameter
<tt>SP_STATE_GAMEOVER</tt>. When
<tt>onTick()</tt> is called next it will 
take the appropriate actions needed to switch the game into &quot;game over&quot;
state. This procedure is used for all global state changes.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id434994"></a>MenuScreen and GameScreen</h3></div></div><p>
The <tt>StuntPlane</tt> class creates two Screens, the
<tt>MenuScreen</tt> and the
<tt>GameScreen</tt>. A <tt>Screen</tt> is basically just a
wrapper for the <tt>XFcRenderer</tt> and
<tt>XFcController</tt> interfaces. It's defined in
<tt>Screen.h</tt>.
</p><p>
The <tt>MenuScreen</tt> takes care of rendering and input for both the main
menu and the options menu, as well as initial splash screens and
the highscore display. What to render is determined by the current 
application state, and is selected using a switch statement in the
<tt>render()</tt> method. The control is delegated in the same way.
The same menu graphics and font are used for all resolutions. The game logo
is linearily scaled to fit the current display dimensions. The menu text
is placed to fill up the remaining space. This is ok for example purposes, but
if this were a real game we would most likely want to either use different graphics for different
resolutions or use the <tt>XFcGLSurfaceToolkit</tt> to rescale the
graphics more accurately.
</p><p>
The <tt>GameScreen</tt> takes care of rendering the ingame
graphics. It's also used to render loading screens, level complete
messages and game over messages, which are overlays on top of the
slightly modified ingame graphics. For example, the loading screen
renders the ingame graphics as usual (except for the status
indicators), brightens the image a bit and then draws the loading text
on top of that. This enables the player to get an idea of what the
next level looks like while waiting for takeoff.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id434705"></a>Levels</h3></div></div><p>
A level is basically a rectangular volume in space containing some
hoops, some bonus items and a number of clouds. Theese are all 2D
bitmaps. The width and height of a level is hardcoded to 320 length
units (-160,160). The depth is specified in the level file and is 
usually about 2000 length units.
</p><p>
The level layout is loaded and parsed from plain text files. The format
is quite simple. An example of a minimal but commented level file might
look like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
# level1.txt

# Level info: 
# background image, length, startx, starty, loading screen text

LEVEL=backdrop1.pcx, 1200, 0, 0, I can fly!

# Wind info:
# strength(100 = strong), initial direction(0-360 deg), rotation speed, gust factor (100 = strong)

WIND=20, 180, 10, 10

# Cloud info:
# sprite image, number of clouds visible at the same time.

CLOUDS=cloud.pcx, 10

# Hoop info:
# sprite image,   x,   y,   z,   hx,  hy,  hr,    allowed rotation (o=any)
 
HOOP=hoop1.pcx,  20,   0,  120,   0,   0,  20.0,   o

# Bonus item info:
# sprite image, x, y, z, bonus points

BONUS=redballoon128.pcx,     0,  32,   80,   50
</pre><p>  
The parsing is done using three <tt>XFuTokenizer</tt> objects. One for splitting
the file into a set of lines, another for splitting the command and
parameter list, and a third one for splitting the parameter list into
single parameters.
</p><p>
The hoops and the bonus items are placed in the level as specified in
the level file while the locations of the clouds are randomly generated.
The background image specified in the level file is panned as the plane
turns back and forth to make the movement more apparent.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id435442"></a>The Plane Model</h3></div></div><p>
The plane is a 3D mesh created using 3DSMax and exported to an XFF file.
The loader only reads the information that is really needed by the 
game and ignores the rest. In this case we only need a mesh node, 
a vertex buffer, a triangle info buffer, and a face list. 
The plane is rendered using Gouraud shaded, untextured triangles.
The <tt>XFFPlayer</tt> core example provides a more 
complete example of how to read and display the contents of XFF files. 
</p><p>
The plane also has a rotating propeller. The propeller is not
described in the XFF file but instead animated and rendered 
using hardcoded vertex information in the source code. 
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id435492"></a>Sprites</h3></div></div><p>
3D sprites (Billboards) are used to draw hoops, bonus items and clouds. Theese 
are basically 2D bitmaps given a size and 3d dimensonal space 
coordinates. They are then automatically scaled and rendered using this
information by a call to the <tt>XFcGL</tt> method
<tt>drawSprite3dBillboard()</tt>.
The collision detection between the plane and sprites is very simple, using
just some quick bounding sphere/bounding cylinder calculations.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id434737"></a>Gameplay</h3></div></div><p>
As stated earlier, the plane can be controlled in the vertical (xy) plane while
it's forward speed in the z direction is constant. Although it appears as the 
plane is moving forward it actually always stays at the origin. The objects 
are instead moved towards the plane, in the negative z direction.
</p><p>
The game logic is updated by calling <tt>updateGameLogic()</tt> in the <tt>GameScreen</tt> class.
This method advances the current time of the game physics by a fixed amount.
<tt>updateGameLogic()</tt> is called repeatedly until the game time has caugth up with 
the actual time as returned by <tt>XFcCore::getTick()</tt>.
</p><p>
As long as the player keeps a key pressed down for movement in some direction 
a constant acceleration is added to the current speed of the plane towards that
direction, given that the speed is not larger than a constant, predefined
maximum speed. As a very simplified emulation of air resistance the current
horizontal and vertical speed of the plane is multiplied by a constant 
slightly less than 1 on every game logic iteration. Thus, the speed will
decrease automatically when the player doesn't keep the key pressed down.  
In addition, wind is simulated by adding a small amount of speed in some direction
during each game logic iteration.
