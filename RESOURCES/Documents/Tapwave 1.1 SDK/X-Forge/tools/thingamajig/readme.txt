
THINGAMAJIG

ThinGamaJig is a particle system editor, designed to produce light but
visually impressive particle systems. Install ThinGamaJig by copying all
files from the thingamajig directory in the X-Forge SDK to a new empty
directory on a hard drive on your computer, for example c:\thingamajig.
After that, the application can simply be run from that directory.

See the X-Forge guide for usage and other documentation.
