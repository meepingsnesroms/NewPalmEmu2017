
PROFILE ANALYZER

The profile analyzer tool is used to analyze the raw data that the X-Forge
profiler produces. Note that the sampling profiler in the X-forge core only
works under ARM PockerPC. To install the profile analyzer, simply copy the
profileanalyzer.exe file to a directory that is in your operating system
executable search path.

See the X-Forge guide for usage and other documentation.
