/****************************************************************************
 *
 * Callback Reference
 *
 ****************************************************************************/

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The stack calls the application via a callback function stored in each
 * IrConnect structure. The callback function is called with a pointer to
 * the IrConnect structure and a pointer to a parameter structure. The
 * parameter structure contains an event field which indicates the reason 
 * the callback is called and other parameters which have meaning based
 * on the event.
 *
 * The meaning of the events are as follows:
 *
 * LEVENT_LM_CON_IND - Other device has initiated a connection. IR_ConnectRsp
 * should be called to accept the connection. Any data associated with the
 * connection request can be found using fields rxBuff and rxLen for the
 * data pointer and length respectively. 
 * 
 * LEVENT_LM_DISCON_IND - The IrLMP/Tiny TP connection has been disconnected.
 * Any data associated with the disconnect indication can be found using 
 * fields rxBuff and rxLen for the data pointer and length respectively. 
 * 
 * LEVENT_DATA_IND - Data has been received. The received data is accessed 
 * using fields rxBuff and rxLen; 
 * 
 * LEVENT_PACKET_HANDLED - A packet is being returned. A pointer to the 
 * packet exists in field packet. 
 * 
 * LEVENT_LAP_CON_IND - Indicates that the IrLAP connection has come up. The 
 * callback of all bound IrConnect structures is called. 
 *
 * LEVENT_LAP_DISCON_IND - Indicates that the IrLAP connection has gone 
 * down. This means that all IrLMP connections are also down. A callback 
 * with event LEVENT_LM_CON_IND will not be given. The callback function 
 * of all bound IrConnect structures is called.
 *
 * LEVENT_DISCOVERY_CNF - Indicates the completion of a discovery operation. 
 * The field deviceList points to the discovery list.
 * 
 * LEVENT_LAP_CON_CNF - The requested IrLAP connection has been made
 * successfully. The callback function of all bound IrConnect structures
 * is called.
 *
 * LEVENT_LM_CON_CNF - The requested IrLMP/Tiny TP connection has been made
 * successfully. Connection data from the other side is found using fields
 * rxBuff and rxLen.
 * 
 * LEVENT_STATUS_IND - Indicates that a status event from the stack has 
 * occured. The status field indicates the status generating the event. 
 * Possible statuses are as follows. Note this event is optional:
 *    IR_STATUS_NO_PROGRESS - means that IrLAP has no progress for 3 seconds
 *    threshold time (e.g. beam is blocked).
 *
 *    IR_STATUS_LINK_OK - indicates that the no progress condition has
 *    cleared.
 *
 *    IR_STATUS_MEDIA_NOT_BUSY - indicates that the IR media has 
 *    transitioned from busy to not busy.
 *
 * LEVENT_TEST_IND - Indicates that a TEST command frame has been received.
 * A pointer to the received data is in rxBuff and rxLen. A pointer to the
 * packet that will be sent in response to the test command is in the packet
 * field. The packet is currently setup to respond with the same data sent
 * in the command TEST frame. If different data is desired as a response
 * then modify the packet structure. This event is sent to the callback 
 * function in all bound IrConnect structures. The IAS connections ignore 
 * this event. 
 *
 * LEVENT_TEST_CNF - Indicates that a TEST command has completed. The status
 * field indicates if the test was successful. IR_STATUS_SUCCESS indicates
 * that operation was successful and the data in the test response can be
 * found by using the rxBuff and rxLen fields. IR_STATUS_FAILED indicates 
 * that no TEST response was received. The packet passed to perform the test 
 * command is passed back in the packet field and is now available (no 
 * separate packet handled event will occur).
