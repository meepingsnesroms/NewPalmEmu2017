 *	Description
 *	-----------
 *	
 *		Although a host operating system will usually provide memory management
 *		primitives, they are often not very efficient at the management of many
 *		small to medium sized blocks of nonrelocatable storage. These routines
 *		provide for an efficient system of memory pool management on top of such
 *		host primitives.
 *	
 *	Implementation
 *	--------------
 *	
 *		The dynamic allocation scheme used here is based in large part on
 *		techniques presented in Section 2.5 of Knuth's "The Art of Computer
 *		Programming, Vol. 1".
 *		
 *		Basically, allocated memory is drawn from a circular, doubly-linked list of
 *		available blocks of memory. The list is kept in no particular order and the
 *		first block encountered in the list that is large enough to satisfy an
 *		allocation request is used.
 *		
 *		Excess bytes in a block are split off and returned to the list. However,
 *		pad bytes needed to maintain a given storage alignment are not split off.
 *		Furthermore, if the number of excess bytes remaining is less than a certain
 *		amount, then no bytes are split off from the allocated block to prevent
 *		excessive fragmentation.
 *		
 *		Each available block of memory begins and ends with a special "tag" field.
 *		This tag identifies the size of the block. In addition, the tag at the
 *		beginning of a block indicates whether the block is available or not and
 *		also whether the immediately preceding block is available or not. This
 *		information is used when a block is deallocated to determine whether or not
 *		to merge adjacent blocks.
 *		
 *		Traditionally, information about the availability of the preceding block
 *		would be kept in a reserved area at the end of the block, and this would
 *		necessarily be so even when the block is in use. This, however, would waste
 *		storage since only a single bit is required but one or more bytes woiuld
 *		need to be reserved for it (usually at least four to maintain a desired
 *		storage alignment).
 *		
 *		When an allocation request is made that cannot be satisfied by any
 *		available block, an attempt is made to acquire a block of memory from the
 *		host. In order to distinguish such a block from the kind of blocks we are
 *		managing, we shall call it a heap. Enough bytes are requested from the host
 *		to satisfy the request, including any bytes needed for overhead, but never
 *		less than some minimum amount. The heap is made to look like an available
 *		block and then passed on to satisfy the request. If fewer bytes are needed
 *		than we acquired, then the block is split with excess bytes made available
 *		as above.
 *		
 *		Initially, there are no available blocks preallocated, and therefore the
 *		first allocation request will necessarily require the acquisition of a
 *		heap.
 *		
 *		Since the tag field will have to be reserved for every block, whether
 *		allocated or not, we will want to ensure that it consumes as little storage
 *		as possible. We need only a few bits for availability info. Block size
 *		needs to be larger than a short int (16 bits), but not necessarily as large
 *		as a full long int (32 bits). Therefore, we ought to be able to pack
 *		everything into a single 4-byte field.
 *		
 *		The "proper" way to do this in C would be to use bitfields. However, the
 *		specification of bitfields is so riddled with implementation-defined areas
 *		that we cannot ensure that their use would be effective on all platforms.
 *		Therefore, we will instead use the & and | operators to manipulate the bit
 *		quantities. We will avoid having to use << and/or >> on the size quantity
 *		by asserting that the size of all blocks must be a multiple of 4 bytes
 *		(which is a useful assertion for performance reasons as well), giving us
 *		use of the 2 low-order bits for availability.
 *		
 *		In addition, we will make the (not unreasonable) assertion that the size of
 *		a block must always be non-negative. This gives us use of the high-order
 *		sign bit as well. However, trying to isolate the sign bit is difficult to
 *		do in an implementation-independent manner, so we will simply assert that
 *		any negative value has special significance.
 *		
 *		In particular, we will ensure that each host-allocated block begins and
 *		ends with a tag indicating a size of -1L so that we can identify the
 *		boundaries of the block from the inside at deallocation time. This serves
 *		two purposes: (1) it ensures that memory preceding or following the heap
 *		never inadvertantly becomes a candidate for merging and (2) it permits
 *		detection of when the entire heap becomes available again, at which point
 *		it may be returned to the host if desired.
 *		
 *		Here is a graphical spin on things that hopefully makes things a little
 *		clearer:

 *	POOLS
 *	The memory pool is a collection of heaps of memory that can be used to allocate
 *	memory. The memory pool has header information and the rest is a heap of memory.
 *	Other heaps may be added to the memory pool at alternate locations.
 *	
 *	HEAPS
 *	Heaps of memory start and end with a -1 (FFFFFFFC). Heaps contain block of 
 *	memory that are either full of data or empty.
 *
 *	BLOCKS
 *	Empty Blocks 
 *		Begin with:
 *			A block_header that contains a tag, a next available block pointer,
 *			and a previous available block pointer. The tag must be non-negative and it 
 *			contains the length of the block. The 2 low	order bits indicate wether the 
 *			block is in use, and wether the previous block is	in use.	The next available 
 *			and previous available pointer point to the next and previous available 
 *			blocks of memory
 *		Contain:
 *			Free space
 *		End with:
 *			A block_trailer which is the same as the block header tag with the in 
 *			use bits cleared.
 * 
 *	Full Blocks
 *		Begin with: 
 *			the same tag as the emtpy block which contains the length	of the block. 
 *			The 2 low	order bits indicate wether the block is in use, and wether
 *			the previous block is	in use.
 *		Contain:
 *			Data
 *		End with:
 *			Data. Note that Blocks that are full of data do not have the block_trailer
 *			although you may see one left over from initialization if that  block is a pad 
 *			byte (see contents of 00DE7860, and notice also 00DE7C58 in the example below).
 *			Also the 2 low order bits of the block's length indicate if the block is in 
 *			use and if the previous block is in use.
 *	
 *	Below is an example a memory pool that has been intialized as follows:
 *				init_alloc(0x00DE7830, 1024);
 *				init_alloc(0x00DE7C40, 1024);
 *	
 *	Some data has been allocated using malloc for a series of 6 long integers (set to
 *  0x32323232) and 5 long integers (set to 31313131). integers. Below is how the 
 *	memory looks.

 *	Pool Options
 *	------------
 *
 *	The following low-level options may be set for each memory pool object
 *	after __init_pool_obj has been called for that object (see pool_alloc.h):
 *	
 *	  sys_alloc_func points to a function that is called to acquire memory
 *	  blocks from the host environment. It takes an unsigned long as the
 *	  number of bytes needed and returns either NULL or a pointer to a newly
 *	  allocated block. If sys_alloc_func is NULL, then no attempt is made
 *	  to automatically acquire memory from the host environment. However, it
 *	  is still possible to supply the pool with memory on a manual basis
 *	  via __pool_preassign.
 *	  
 *	  sys_free_func points to a free function that is called to return
 *	  memory blocks to the host environment. This happens when a call to
 *	  __pool_free causes a heap to become entirely free. If sys_free_func
 *		is NULL, then no attempt is made to return memory to the host
 *		environment.
 *	  
 *	  A request for a block sized greater than 'min_heap_size' is always
 *	  allocated a heap all its own (with the exception noted below).
 *	  
 *	  Whenever a smaller request can't be satisfied from the list of
 *	  available blocks, a new heap of size 'min_heap_size' is created and
 *	  the requested block is allocated from it.
 *
 *		Normally, a new heap would be created for a request greater than
 *		min_heap_size bytes even if a block of the requested size is
 *		already available. The 'always_search_first' flags forces
 *		__pool_alloc to check first and this flag is set by __pool_preallocate
 *		to enable you to allocate whatever you preallocate.

/* Change record:
 * JFH 950224 First code release.
 * JFH 950310 Removed hash buckets. Was actually slowing things down.
 * JFH 950314 Fixed bug in merge_block causing it to call sys_free at
 *            inappropriate times. Also added missing 'return' at end
 *            of 'calloc'.
 * JFH 950320 Transformed code from an implementation of malloc, free,
 *            etc. into a more generic tool for manipulating memory pool
 *            objects. Needless to say, one such object will be used by
 *            malloc, free, etc.
 * JFH 950324 Rearranged code so that certain compile-time options
 *            became run-time options. Specifically, sys_alloc and
 *            sys_free are accessed through pointers that may be
 *            overridden. min_heap_size is no longer constant. A new
 *            option named 'new_heap_size' was added. This now becomes
 *            congruent with '_newpoolsize' and '_newnonptrmax' in
 *            NewXX.cp.
 * JFH 950427 Added capability to pre-allocate or pre-assign memory to
 *            a given pool.
 * JFH 950814 Pulled new_heap_size out of the equation. The min/new
 *			  dichotomy was confusing at best and led to some interesting
 *			  pathological situations in situations, particularly
 *			  involving __pool_preallocate. Added an option flag,
 *			  always_search_first, that tells __pool_alloc to always search
 *			  the free list, even if the requested block is greater than
 *			  min_heap_size bytes. This flag is set by __pool_preallocate.
 * JFH 951012 Moved #include of <Memory.h> to pool_alloc.mac.c
 * JFH 951017 Changed names to protect the innocent
 * JFH 951213 Fixed bug in __pool_alloc where a size within 3 of ULONG_MAX
 *			  would overflow to a more reasonable value when adding overhead.
 *			  Overflow checking now performed.
 * JFH 960122 Added casts from (void *) for C++ compatibility.
 * JFH 960429 Merged Win32 changes in.
 * GRG 961205 Added init_alloc function for systems with no system memory 
 *			  routines. Since there were no system memory routines, all the
 *			  option flags were no longer needed, and all code pertaining to
 *			  them was commented out.
 * DLP 970404 DLP  Added userData field to mem_pool_obj for use by pool_alloc clients.
 *			  The sys_alloc and sys_free functions now take a parameter to the
 *			  mem_pool_obj so these functions can use the userData field to 
 *			  access application-specific data.
 *			  Added __pool_free_all() to free all the memory allocated by a pool.
 * MEA 970623 Merged PPC EABI changes in.
 * MEA 970720 Changed __no_os to _No_Alloc_OS_Support.	
 * hh  990227 Logic rewritten and moved into alloc.c.  Same algorithm exists in alloc.c as "Design 1".
 * BOBC990302 AltiVec requires larger alignment (in a seperate pool).
 * hh  990504 Corrected prototypes for split_block and grow_block
 * vss 990808 Empty file is non-standard, but we're going to ignore it anyway
 * cc  020109 Added _MSL_CDECL work 
 * hh  020214 Renamed _MSL_PRO4_MALLOC to _MSL_CLASSIC_MALLOC
