/* Change record:
 * JFH 950719 First code release.
 * JFH 960129 Fixed bug where the sense of the compare_members arguments was reversed.
 *			  Also made some small performance improvements (courtesy of Fabrizio Oddone).
 * JFH 960220 Fixed small bug in "performance improvement" where 'r' (which was *unsigned*)
 *			  could wrap from zero to ULONG_MAX. Rather than take the performance hit
 *			  back, num_members is constrained to fit in a *signed* long. If it doesn't,
 *			  we return NULL immediately.
 * JFH 960227 Fabrizio convinced me to undo the previous change and fix the bug in a
 *			  different way. We basically preflight to make sure the fatal condition
 *			  doesn't occur.
 * mm  961031 Improved legibility of function declaration
 * cc  011203 Added _MSL_CDECL for new name mangling
