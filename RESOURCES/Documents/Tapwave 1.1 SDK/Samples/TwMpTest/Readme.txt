This example is intended to demonstrate the Tapwave multiplayer game invitation
APIs (TwMp).  This example shows how you can use the TwMp APIs to improve the 
process of starting multiplayer games.  With TwMp you can invite someone to play
a game even if the game is not the currently running application.  The example
also keeps all users informed of the invitation status of each invited device.   

To run the app make sure TwMpTest is present on the device or an SD card inserted
into a device.  On the game host, select "Host" from the menu and pick the other
devices to invite.
