	File:		DRMStaticData.c

	Description:This file contains all the static data for the application-based DRM
				protection.

				It's ok to include this file in different files of your project.  
				You'll get extra copies of the data, but it's all constant data 
				and will make hacking your application more difficult.

				Note that you should still take the time to make your own version of 
				this code so an automated hacking tool cannot strip this code out of
				your PRC.
