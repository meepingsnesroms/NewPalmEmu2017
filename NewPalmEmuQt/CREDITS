I do not care about licences or legal crap!!!

I used whatever librarys and code worked best and will give proper credit
for them, other than that I do not care what your licence is or if I stole
your code.

ALL INFORMATION IS FAIR USE.

There was a mistake here that listed the ARM emulator developer as:
GB Enhanced+ (Daniel Baxter)

This was correct at one point but I found a smaller ARM emulator and this is no longer correct.
The developer of the new ARM emulator will not be credited due to previous wrongdoings.
(I bought one of his apps and he ignored me for 3 months before giving me the unlock code, by then I had already found a working crack.)
I have nothing against the developer of GB Enhanced+ nor did he do anything wrong.
