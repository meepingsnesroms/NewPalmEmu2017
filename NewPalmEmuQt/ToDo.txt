support 'appInfo' and 'sortInfo' prc attributes
block direct writes to storage ram
make while(true){...} pause and stop with emulator
render blinking cursor and radioacive border for object with focus
find out if every object is sent every event or if the target object is found and only it is sent the event(currently doing the 2nd)
count taps on field (1=place cursor,2=select word,3=select line)
setjmp()/longjmp() apis
exception list for for palms try/catch/throw macros
disable rom writes again(Platypus trys to write to rom)(May need to leave them enabled for apps that have a built in bootloader)

simulate os funcions running on emulated cpu by adding * many cycles based on how much work was done

Fix winPaintBitmap render modes
Move drawing functions (eg draw rect,circle,triangle) out of displaydriver.cpp

fix potential crash where one api calls back into a 68k function that
calls another api,overwriteing LINK(SP) and making all variables retrived
by the first api call after returning from the 68k invalid.

get android compiling with clang (current error is "library not found for -lGLESv2")

find default value of drawstate windrawoperation

find out if vvv(below) returns an invlid value
int x(){
...
}
meep y(int& in){
...
}
void main(){
    y(x());//point of test
    ...
}

investigate bitmap transparncy (assumed not working right now)
fix touchscreen scaleing and mapping



/*done*/
Reenable text rendering
must change osevtqueue to be able to access more than the front or back (EvtAddUniqueEventToQueue wont work until then)
find file type(prc/pdb) without assuming based on the file name
make palmmalloc use free chunks before getting fresh memory from malloc stack
zero out name fields for 32 bytes in memcardinfo();
clean up 'palmwrapper.h' and files using it as a universal header

'ovly' Overlay Support (DONE)
Bitmap RLE Compression
remove unneeded headers from cpu*.cpp,only need "newcpu.h"
put back std::to_string for android //removed it completely
Rename memswap function to not conflict with C/C++ in some cases
